1,"I just realized that there is not coverage for my area, which I am surprised. I wonder why this information is not provided in the product description since I ended up with an expensive device I can't even activate. Even after struggling with the headache of activating it, when you go to Starlink website, there is no contacts for customer support for one to reach out to get the appropriate support. Also at the base of the Starlink dish where it fits into the stand, there were some marks.I suspect the product was used and somebody returned it."
2,Latency too high
3,"The kit as delivered requires an additional adapter to be integrated into an existing network.  Mounts sold on Jumia don’t work, buy directly from Starlink who deliver quickly. Speeds vary from 50mb/s to 140mb/s, but that depends on time of day and line of sight. Upload speeds are around 15-20mb/s. Slower upload speeds can be a problem if several people are online on calls."
4,Outstanding speeds
5,perfect
6,Plug and play.
7,Worked perfectly
8,"Got exactly what I expected, easy pickup, easy installation, and works very reliably"
9,It worked for a few minutes then just randomly stopped working. After contacting Starlink support they sent out a new cable but that still hadn’t changed anything. The dish appeared to have been used and damaged i don’t know
10,excellent product
11,It was delivered on time.
12,"With a clear view of the sky, the kit works as expected (any obstructions will impact performance). Download speeds are awesome  and you won't get undersea cable cut incidents as you're connected to satellites. Can be a good backup for local fiber-optic internet. Monthly fee is a bit costly but it will get better with time."
13,Working perfectly
14,Speeds upto 312mbps

16,Very fast internet
17,Pure greatness

19,"Starlink arrived as promised. Works as expected. This is the best access at this time, especially for remote and underdeveloped areas with unreliable cellular internet. Just make sure you have as much unobstructed view of the sky as possible. Highly recommend if you can afford it."

30,I got my Starlink Kit on Jumia and I am so happy with the quality of the internet - way better and overall cheaper than Safaricom.
31,"It has been 2 months of use and the device/hardware was delivered okay and all is working well, no dents on the packaging whatsoever. Comes with a manual and a sealed box. Caveat to note when buying from an authorized reseller is 1st check with starlink.com if there is coverage in your area else you might end up with a device that you can’t use due to location restrictions ora device you can use albeit with a service plan you did not intend to have.Good news is internet issues are a thing of the past. Speeds range between 70Mbps to 300Mbps. (From the tests done so far).Point to note if you need any extra mounts and accessories get them from starlink.com.The starlink app works well and has alot of features. I would suggest some research 1st before proceeding with the purchase. Simple YT vids should suffice."
32,The antenna and router took about 15 minutes to set up from opening the box. After that everything was automatic. Fast enough to stream Netflix and YouTube. Great service.
33,It is very fast and efficient
34,The device is reliable and I am able to receive internet with speeds of 200mb/s in rural Kenya.

45,"It's next gen technology, but because of price people are not buying."
46,Delivery on time  works perfectly. Recommend
47,"Good speed low latency though, improve on that and we are good to go"
48,The internet is more reliable than big local providers. No regrets. The router's wifi signal is not as strong. You might need a WIFI extender or ethernet adapter if you have a bigger compound.
49,I would like to say that the process of setting up the standing course a bit challenging. specially it requires a clear view of the sky so if you you need to ensure that there is they are no obstructions at all. yeah but after it was uh setup it works great and considering mine has an obstruction on the western side it work great.
50,As long as it has a clear line of sight with the sky. You'll never be disappointed.
51,"It is perfect with fast speeds, and is very reliable. In one word, ""excellent""."

56,I brought it home on friday and have not set it up.The box looks great
57,Works perfectly.Though speed fluctuates between 50 Mbps and 120 Mbps
58,It's as advertised
59,quick delivery
60,Easy install. Easy setup. Superb system.
61,it doesn't work unless connected to power. This is a challenge in rural areas
62,"The product arrived on time but I noticed Jumia cannot support you contact the seller when the product has an issue. I was forced to engage starlink myself and you can only write to them. Funny enough is you get one response in every 24hrs. The simple issue of set up took several days to be resolved. For the internet itself, upload speed are always and unbalanced compared to
 download ones. The latency which is crucial is always above 100. I have also experienced downtime even though it is mounted to a high point with no obstruction. If you are in a place with safaricom home or Fibre home, those are better option than this. If you are in a remote place with no any other means, this can help"
63,"Download speed is good, but the range of network is wanting. Very short range."
64,"Despite my best efforts calling the customer call centre and requesting for an ETR invoice, I ended up placing and completing my order without the ETR because it was taking too long and the call centre staff sounded unsure on what process to follow to get an ETR"
65,It has very fast internet speeds faster that even the LAN networks
66,Quick service
67,"Flawless internet at high speed, easy to set up and administer. Very recommendable"
68,Works very well.
69,The internet speeds are just amazing

71,Stable and fast speeds
72,Speed is amazing
73,no more thinking about booster locaion can camp anywhere and work from anywhere
74,"This is the best ISP in kenya price to performance wise. Installation is simple. the kit is actually new rather than refurbished as people claim. Effects on weather is so minimal you won't notice it. My only gripe is that the wifi signal on both 2.4 and 5GHZ is pretty weak.
average speeds is about 80 Mbps and peak I've got is 260 Mbps"
75,Activation and payment modalities clarity is still a nightmare given it is in a new market.
76,"Amazing speeds ,even with obstructions,  i would recommend it ,  hardware build is very good"
77,perfect
78,"It was easy to install and set up. I have better internet connection than before, and even though cables are down I am able to hold zoom meetings well"
79,"Works perfectly, It's just super, Internet speed is superfast and no buffering, I use it in an urban area (surrounded by buildings) and if you intend to do the same, just ensure you have a clear view of the sky without any obstruction on the South side as the dish is pointing in that direction, thank you Starlink for giving us a wonderful product and thank you Jumia for making it available in Kenya."
80,Best
81,Took a bit of setting up as would not activate easily but a few emails back and forth to Starlink and all sorted and amazing internet speeds in the bush

86,As expected
87,Very Easy Setup. Just needs good sky coverage
88,Works perfectly like promised
